# credit-risk-classification

**Credit Analysis Report**

*Overview*<br>
The purpose of this analysis is to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.The main goal is to predict healthy loans vs high-risk loans. 

*Accuracy* - The model has a very high accuracy score of 0.99. Thus, it correctly predicts 99% of the samples in the dataset. <br>
*Precision* <br>
    -For 0 (healthy loan), precision is 1.00, meaning there are no false positives.<br> 
    -For 1 (high-risk loan), precision is 0.87, meaning there is a low chance of false positives.<br>
*Recall*
    -For 0 (healthy loan), recall is 1.00, meaning there are no false negatives.<br>
    -For 1 (high-risk loan), recall is 0.89, meaning there is a low chance of false negatives<br>

*Summary*<br>
I would recommend this model to be used by the company because it is very accurate and has strong metrics. The perfect scores on the healthy loans ensure that healthy loans are properly identified, with no false positives or false negatives. Although the scores for the high-risk loans are lower, I believe it is still high enough to identify the high-risk loans. The model can aid the company's decision making process in managing loan approvals and minimizing risks.
